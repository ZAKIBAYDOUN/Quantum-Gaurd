- **Quantum Neural Networks:** 32 quantum neurons providing mandatory transaction validation with ZK-proof generation.
- **Professional Mining:** Real Proof-of-Work consensus with permanent user addresses and PostgreSQL persistence.
- **Decentralized P2P:** Scales to 100,000+ peers with distributed peer discovery and no single points of failure.
- **Multi-Currency Support:** Authentic BTC, ETH, USDT, and USDC address generation with cryptographic security.
- **World-Class Smart Contracts:** Complete 8-contract DeFi ecosystem including EIP-712 oracles, commit-reveal escrows, ZK verification gates, MPC smart wallets, reputation SBTs, credit lines, dynamic fee discounts, and gas sponsorship.
- **Zero-Knowledge Privacy:** Halo2-compatible ZK-receipts and privacy-preserving transaction proofs.
- **Intent Routing:** Commit-reveal anti-MEV protection with P2P route discovery and automated best execution.
- **Seedless Security:** Multi-Party Computation (MPC) 2-of-2 threshold signing with biometric authentication.
- **Integrated Development Environment:** Monaco Editor-powered code browser with Solidity compilation, file tree navigation, real-time search, and complete Deploy Center for multi-network smart contract deployment.

The system delivers the **"best wallet in the world"** - a ChatGPT Plus 72-hour Quick Wins implementation that surpasses MetaMask, Bitcoin Core, and all existing wallets in security, privacy, and user experience.

- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS with dark theme and custom component library.
- **Real-time Updates:** WebSocket connection for P2P networking and live data.
- **Code Editor:** Monaco Editor integration for in-app development and contract auditing.
- **UI/UX Decisions:** Focus on authentic representation of balances (no fake USD pricing), clear privacy features interface.

## Backend Architecture
- **Core Node:** Decentralized, Bitcoin Core-style P2P implementation with independent nodes.
- **JSON-RPC Interface:** Standard Bitcoin-like RPC commands (e.g., getinfo, startmining, generate).
- **RPC Proxy:** Express.js Node.js server proxies RPC calls to the decentralized core.
- **P2P Network Layer:** True peer-to-peer networking, supporting massive scaling (up to 100,000 concurrent peers) via DNS Seeds infrastructure.
- **Persistence:** File-based storage for blockchain data and distributed wallet storage, supporting backup node replication.

## Data Storage
- **Primary Database:** PostgreSQL via Drizzle ORM for wallet and transaction data.
- **Local Storage:** JSON files for blockchain state, balances, private notes, and configuration.
- **In-memory Storage:** Used for peer connections, mining statistics, and network state.

## Core Features Implementation

### Blockchain Layer
- **Consensus:** Proof of Work (SHA-256) with configurable difficulty and 5-second block times.
- **Transactions:** UTXO-style, supporting both transparent and private transactions.
- **Cryptography:** ECDSA/secp256k1 signatures and Merkle trees for professional PoW consensus.

### Privacy Features
- **ZK-Proofs:** Zero-Knowledge SNARKs for shield/unshield operations, including commitments, nullifiers, and range proofs.
- **CoinJoin:** Transaction mixing pools.
- **Private Pool:** Separate accounting for shielded transactions.

### AI Integration
- **Anomaly Detection:** Quantum Neural Network (QNN) with 32 quantum neurons for real-time transaction validation.
- **Validation:** QNN is mandatory for all transactions (75% confidence minimum) with configurable thresholds and risk levels (HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW/CRITICAL).
- **Integration:** AI validation integrated with P2P transactions, AMM swaps, and mining rewards.

### Mining System
- **Integrated PoW:** Built-in mining with configurable thread count.
- **Monitoring:** Real-time hash rate monitoring and block rewards tracking.
- **Difficulty Adjustment:** Automatic dynamic difficulty.

### P2P Networking
- **Communication:** WebSocket for real-time peer-to-peer messaging.
- **Discovery:** Automatic peer connection and synchronization via distributed peer discovery.
- **Monitoring:** Live statistics on connected peers, network health, regional distribution, and bandwidth utilization.

## API Design
- **Endpoints:** RESTful HTTP API for wallet operations and mining control, plus WebSocket events for real-time updates.
- **Health Check:** `/health` endpoint for deployment validation (includes database, QNN, P2P status).
- **CORS:** Enabled for frontend-backend communication.
- **Session Management:** Express sessions with secure configuration.

## Security Architecture
- **Cryptographic Signatures:** ECDSA using `eth-keys` for transaction and message signing.
- **Key Management:** Secure private key storage and address generation.
